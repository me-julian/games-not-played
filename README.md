# React App with Identity Access & Management

Mock react app to get a working tech stack set up with auth using Passport.

This branch is my second attempt using Passport, this time using JWT tokens.

## Tech Stack

-   [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) Monorepo
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
-   [VS Code Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) & Bash scripts
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) & [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API & Distribution Server
-   MySQL Database with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) using [sequelize-typescript](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-typescript)
-   [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) for email & password authentication with JWT
-   [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

## Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Linux users should install [Docker Engine, Docker CLI & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Windows and macOS users will need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
Windows users should also ensure [WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) is enabled.

More info on ensuring your Docker installation is compatible with VS Code dev containers can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

## Hosting the app

Will eventually be set up to push images to docker hub for cloud hosting.

Using the `Build` task in VS Code will build the app for production.

## Setting up for development

This project uses [VS Code development containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Make sure you've installed the Dev Containers extension by Microsoft in VS Code.

Either: Clone the repository locally and use the `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container` task.

OR: Use `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume`. Recommended for Windows or macOS users as it will run much faster.

The database container will automatically start when opening the dev container. Run the `First Time Setup` task to create and migrate the database schemas. [See below](#initial-database-setup) for more info on working with the database.

Run the `Dev` task in the command palette to start the client and api and start developing.

Connect to the app on your host machine at _localhost:5173_.

## Working with the database

This project uses database migrations and these must be run to get the database into a usable state.

### Initial database setup

Run the `First Time DB Setup` task to create the database and migrate the database to the latest version. Separate `Create Database` and `Migrate Database` tasks are also available.

### Creating new migrations

You can use the Sequelize CLI to [generate migration scripts and models](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/#creating-the-first-model-and-migration).

Models generated by the CLI must be manually converted to typescript. They must also be manually updated to reflect changes in the database caused by additional migrations.

Migration scripts must remain Javascript. CLI generated migrations will also often need manual tweaking, e.g. adding constraints to columns.

To see exactly what files are going to be used by the CLI on running migrations you can look at the .sequelizerc file.

### Migrating the database

The `Migrate Database` task will apply any existing and new migrations.

## Testing

Make sure the API server is running with the `Start Server` or `Dev` tasks.

Use the `Test` task to run automated testing.
